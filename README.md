# Machine Learning assignment 1

## Prerequisites
You need to install Python 3 (at least), I don't garanty that it works under the version 3 of Python.
If you didn't have python installed already you can follow this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
</br>

To run the python script in the a docker environment you obviously need to install docker, [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
</br>

If you're using Fedora 31, I recommend you to follow this [blog](https://medium.com/@drpdishant/installing-docker-on-fedora-31-a073db823bb8) for the installation. This blog helpes you to fix the cgroup issue on Fedora 31 with docker at the same time.


## Run

### With docker
Simple use the script in a terminal where you have cloned this repository `run_docker.sh` .
If you're on Windows, just copy-paste the docker command line in the script to your terminal. Otherwise you can still run it whitout docker.

### Without docker
Simple open a terminal, go to the directory where you clone this repo and run `./main.py`
On Windows, it might be `python ./main.py` .

## Have fun.
